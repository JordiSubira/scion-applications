SCION Applications
==================

This repository contains the technical documentation for mature SCION applications.

Before you can use any of the SCION applications, you must have access to a SCION network and have a SCION endhost stack installed on your host. 
Start with :doc:`Access and Host configuration <applications/access>` to learn how to configure your host.


.. note::

   This documentation is a work in progress. If you are interested in your application being documented here, please contact us.
